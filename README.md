# Tecnologies Solutions(reasons)
- Spring Boot: 
It allows you to have an application running in production quickly, since it already offers most of the resources ready for use, shortening the code length and following the best design practices with already optimized configurations. Thus, reducing development time and creating the entire application structure with less or almost no configuration. In short, it saves you more time programming than setting up the desktop.

- Swagger:
Model and document REST APIs and also due to the knowledge acquired in previous projects.

-JUnit:
The advantage of doing tests is knowing if the method is meeting the requirements specified in the test itself. You can modify your normal methods and run JUnit to see if your changes have not compromised the result of the modified method.
